# constant-embayment-decompression
A MATLAB code for modeling diffusion of H2O and CO2 through rhyolitic melt embayments during constant, continuous magma decompression. The example is set up to fit H2O and CO2 concentration gradients measured along a quartz-hosted rhyolitic melt embayment that was experimentally decompression from 150 to 30 MPa at a rate of 0.008 MPa/s.
